# Decentralized University Transaction System


## Implementation Details and Analysis:

Software Details:

The implementation of our decentralized university fee transaction system involves several software components and user interfaces. Here are the software details of the transaction web interface:

**1. Solidity Smart Contract:**
   - The smart contract is written in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for Ethereum smart contracts. It contains the necessary functions and variables to facilitate fee transactions and maintain the transaction records on the blockchain.
   

**2. TypeScript Frontend Code:**
   - The frontend code is developed using TypeScript, which enables interaction with the Ethereum blockchain and the smart contract. It includes functions for user authentication, course selection, transaction confirmation, and payment processing.

   
**3. Web-Based Interface:**
   - The web-based interface provides a user-friendly platform for students to interact with the system. It includes login screens, course selection pages, transaction confirmation prompts, and payment processing screens.
   

**4. Test Cases and Analysis:**
   - To ensure the functionality and reliability of the system, a comprehensive set of test cases is performed. The following table presents a sample of test cases and their results:

     | Test Case ID | Description                                             | Expected Result              | Actual Result                | Pass/Fail |
     |--------------|-------------------------------------------------------- |-----------------             |---------------               |-----------|
     | TC-001       | User login with valid credentials                       | Successful login             | Successful login             | Pass      |
     | TC-002       | User login with invalid credentials                     | Login error message          | Login error message          | Pass      |
     | TC-003       | Course selection for a specific user                    | Course selected successfully | Course selected successfully | Pass      |
     | TC-004       | Transaction confirmation for a selected course          | Transaction confirmed        | Transaction confirmed        | Pass      |
     | TC-005       | Payment processing for the confirmed transaction        | Payment successful           | Payment successful           | Pass      |

**5. Performance Analysis:**

   - <p align="justify">In terms of performance, the decentralized university fee transaction system offers several advantages over existing systems. The implementation on the Ethereum blockchain ensures high security and immutability of the transaction records. The system leverages the distributed nature of the blockchain, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries and reducing the risk of transaction fraud.</p>

   - <p align="justify">Furthermore, the use of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) enhances the security of fee transactions by providing cryptographic verification of the authenticity and integrity of the transactions. This adds an additional layer of trust and prevents unauthorized tampering with the transaction data.</p>

   - <p align="justify"> In terms of transaction speed, the system's performance is influenced by the underlying Ethereum network's scalability. The Ethereum blockchain has a certain throughput limitation, which means that the transaction processing speed may vary depending on network congestion and gas fees. However, with ongoing improvements in Ethereum's scalability solutions such as layer-2 protocols and sharding, transaction speeds are expected to improve significantly. </p>

**<p align="justify">In comparison _to existing systems, the proposed decentralized university fee transaction system offers increased transparency, security, and efficiency. It eliminates the reliance on centralized intermediaries and provides students with more control over their fee payments. The integration of the web-based interface enhances user experience and simplifies the fee transaction process. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates promising potential for revolutionizing university fee transactions in a decentralized and_ secure manner. </p>**
